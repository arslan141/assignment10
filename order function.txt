Higher Order Functions vs. Callback Functions:

Higher Order Functions:

A higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result. Higher order functions operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
Callback Functions:

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be "called back" at a later time. Callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations, or to customize the behavior of higher order functions.
Difference:

A higher order function is the function that either takes a function as an argument or returns a function, while a callback function is the function that is passed to another function to be executed later.
